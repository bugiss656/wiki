# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax, created in 2004 by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) with Aaron Swartz. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
